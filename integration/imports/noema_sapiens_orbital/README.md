# Canonical Integration: NOEMA ⇄ SOT ⇄ SapiensOrbital

This sector defines the **canonical bridge** between:
- **NOEMA** as a minimal intentional DSL/spec layer,
- **CIEL-_SOT_Agent** as the canonical Source-of-Truth integration core,
- **SapiensOrbital** as the orbital client/shell and contract surface.

## Canonical rule
This integration is **not** a blind donor merge.

- NOEMA contributes: **language/spec/export surface**.
- SapiensOrbital contributes: **contract and shell model**.
- SOT remains the canonical runtime and registry core.

## What is integrated canonically

### 1. NOEMA as DSL / export surface
NOEMA is treated as a process language for:
- semantic objects,
- directional couplings,
- orbital transfer,
- coherence-bearing energy assertions.

In SOT, NOEMA is integrated first as:
- specification layer,
- export target from the orbital/nonlocal registry,
- human-auditable projection of registry state.

### 2. SapiensOrbital as shell / contract donor
SapiensOrbital is treated as the canonical shell model for:
- session packet shape,
- inference contract fields,
- orbital communication surface,
- UI-as-projection discipline.

In SOT, this is integrated as:
- contract concordance,
- field compatibility checks,
- shell-facing mapping without donor code transplantation.

## Why this is canonical
This preserves the correct hierarchy:
1. **contracts and registry** remain canonical,
2. **orbital/nonlocal graph** remains canonical,
3. **NOEMA** receives exported meaning from canonical state,
4. **SapiensOrbital** receives canonical packets/contracts from SOT.

## Generated artifacts
- `CONTRACT_CONCORDANCE.json`
- `generated/registry_export.noema`

## Scripts
- `scripts/export_orbital_registry_to_noema.py`

## Hard constraint
No donor runtime is treated as Source of Truth. Any future code transplant must be explicit, justified, and mapped back to canonical SOT contracts and registries.
