## Notes

This branch is reserved for publishing the validated v8 cockpit snapshot without touching `main`.
The preferred publication mode is an atomic archive commit rather than expanding hundreds of paths through the connector.

## Notes

This branch is a publication branch for the validated v8 snapshot.
The full binary archive is preserved locally as an exact artifact; the GitHub branch contains the verification manifest and publication metadata.
I did not explode 915 paths through the connector because that would risk a partial, inconsistent repo write.
