# Agent Cross Info

Purpose: coordination layer for multiple agents working on the same repository at the same time.

## Core rules

1. One agent owns one scope at a time.
2. Before editing, claim a scope in the lock table.
3. After editing, record changed files, conflicts, and next handoff.
4. Never silently overwrite another agent's work.
5. If two agents need the same file, split by section or pause and hand off explicitly.

## Status board

- Repository state: active multi-agent mode
- Canonical coordination file: `agentcrossinfo.md`
- Conflict policy: newest change is not canonical unless reviewed against prior entry here
- Active planning successor: `docs/operations/ORBITAL_DYNAMICS_LAW_V0_TODO.md`

## Lock table

| Agent | Scope | Files / Paths | Status | Started UTC | Last update UTC | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent-1 | foundations / glossary / derivations | `systems/CIEL_FOUNDATIONS/**` | active | 2026-03-25T16:00:00Z | 2026-03-25T16:00:00Z | Maintains glossary, symbol normalization, tau-A_ij coupling |
| Agent-2 | repo-wide integration / external imports | `docs/**`, `TODO/**`, import staging | unknown | 2026-03-25T16:00:00Z | 2026-03-25T16:00:00Z | Must declare exact touched files before overwrite |
| Agent-3 | orbital dynamics law v0 planning / operation ledgers | `docs/operations/ORBITAL_DYNAMICS_LAW_V0_TODO.md`, `docs/operations/DOCUMENTATION_CONSISTENCY_AND_COVERAGE_TODO.md`, `AGENT.md`, `agentcrossinfo.md` | active | 2026-04-07T16:35:00Z | 2026-04-07T16:35:00Z | Establishes successor operation planning and cross-ledger handoff |

## Handoff log

### 2026-04-07T16:35:00Z
- Added successor planning handoff from documentation operation to orbital dynamics operation.
- Established new active planning file: `docs/operations/ORBITAL_DYNAMICS_LAW_V0_TODO.md`.
- Updated `AGENT.md` to require per-operation ledgers with predecessor/successor links.
- Reserved planning scope for orbital dynamics law v0 so implementation can start from explicit phases and patchsets.

### 2026-03-25T16:00:00Z
- Added cross-agent coordination protocol.
- Established rule that `tau_i` is coupled to `A_ij` and any agent touching foundations must preserve this constraint.
- Established pending priority: physical glyph normalization and symbol deduplication.

## Required edit template

Each agent appends an entry in this format before and after a patch:

### CLAIM
- Agent:
- Scope:
- Files:
- Reason:
- Expected conflicts:

### RELEASE
- Agent:
- Files changed:
- Symbols touched:
- Tests run:
- Conflicts found:
- Follow-up required:

## Protected concepts

The following items must not be changed implicitly:

- `I0 = ln(2)/(24*pi)` is canonical.
- `0.009` is legacy approximation only.
- `tau_i` is relationally coupled to `A_ij`.
- Physical glyph normalization must prevent duplicated symbol meanings.
- Glossary changes must update both human-readable definitions and registry structures.

## Pending shared priorities

1. Solve physical glyph duplication and encoding damage.
2. Keep `tau_i <-> A_ij` coupling explicit in glossary, derivations, and code.
3. Separate canonical derivations from heuristic branches.
4. Record any disappearing files or inconsistent copies immediately.
5. Use per-operation ledgers with explicit predecessor/successor links for major repo changes.
