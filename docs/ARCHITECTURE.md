# Architecture

## Role

`CIEL-_SOT_Agent` is the integration attractor for a multi-repository ecosystem.
It is not the canonical source of every theory file. It is the place where repository identities,
links, cross-references, and executable integration logic are made explicit.

## Repository topology

### Canon / Seed of the Worlds
Primary source for:
- axioms,
- definitions,
- derivations,
- falsification / verification sectors,
- orbital manifests,
- nonlocal repository hyperspace.

### CIEL Omega demo
Primary source for:
- cockpit UI,
- orbital navigation preview,
- educational analogies,
- presentation surface.

### Metatime
Primary source for:
- historical theory materials,
- simulations,
- phenomenological notes,
- older solver and documentation branches.

### CIEL-_SOT_Agent
Primary source for:
- repository registry,
- machine-readable hyperspace index,
- cross-repository synchronization,
- compatibility and convergence tests,
- seed-oriented runners.

## GitHub as operational attractor

For this integration layer, GitHub is treated as the operational center of truth.
That means:
- history is explicit,
- structure is inspectable,
- semantic drift is easier to detect,
- cross-repository coordination is less private and less ambiguous.

This is an operational claim, not an ontological proof.

## First executable component

The first executable kernel is the **repository phase synchronizer**.
It treats repositories as coupled discrete identities with fields:
- `phi` — semantic phase,
- `spin` — orientational sign / half-spin marker,
- `mass` — informational weight,
- `identity` — stable symbolic label.

Couplings are stored separately and define weighted relations between repositories.
The synchronizer computes:
- weighted Euler vector,
- closure defect,
- pairwise phase tensions,
- simple convergence diagnostics.

## Shell import binding

The first explicit shell-level import binding now targets:

- `AdrianLipa90/ciel-omega-demo`

Within this architecture, that upstream repository is treated as:

- shell,
- cockpit,
- UI surface,
- educational and publication layer,
- runtime presentation layer.

It is not treated here as the engine.

That distinction matters because the future engine-facing direction is reserved for the later `Informational Dynamics` binding.

The current imported shell objects are documented in:

- `docs/CIEL_OMEGA_DEMO_INTEGRATION.md`
- `integration/upstreams/ciel_omega_demo_shell_map.json`

This means the integration layer now distinguishes between:

- **native SOT integration objects**, and
- **imported demo shell objects**.

That separation is required to avoid false canonical ownership and to keep shell-versus-engine architecture legible.

## Cross-reference rule

Every conceptual file in `docs/` should appear in `integration/hyperspace_index.json`.
Machine-readable and human-readable indices must evolve together.
