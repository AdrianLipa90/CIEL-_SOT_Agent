# CIEL/0 Protocol Binding for the Desktop Layer

## Why this note exists

The desktop layer should not only be ergonomically bound to the engine.
It should also be formally interpretable under the CIEL/0 Knowledge Coherence Protocol.

This note states how the desktop layer fits that protocol reading.

## Core interpretation

Within the CIEL/0 protocol reading:

- `CIEL-_SOT_Agent` acts as the authoritative host of upstream truth anchors, report layers, validation surfaces, and bridge reductions
- `CIEL-Desktop` acts as a downstream knowledge/operation surface that must preserve provenance, explicit epistemic status, and reference integrity

## Protocol-level obligations of the desktop layer

The desktop layer should preserve at least the following protocol commitments:

### 1. Identity clarity

Launch surfaces, shell modes, and operator-visible actions must have stable names and non-ambiguous roles.

### 2. Provenance honesty

Rendered state should be traceable back to engine-side sources, bridge outputs, registries, or reports.
UI polish must not sever provenance.

### 3. Epistemic honesty

The desktop layer should not present provisional or inferred state as if it were canonical upstream truth.

### 4. Reference integrity

Operator-facing references to reports, objects, panels, or contracts should remain resolvable and explicitly named.

### 5. Binding closure

Any downstream action that writes or triggers state should bind back into SoT-visible artifacts or accepted anchors.
No meaningful desktop-side action should float without an upstream-visible trace.

## Four-representation reading

The desktop layer also fits the Four-Representation Rule indirectly:

- ontology / role: operator shell, presentation layer
- formal definition: global binding + protocol interpretation
- executable code: launchers, shells, adapter bridge
- epistemic/tests: smoke tests, manual checklists, explicit merge-readiness notes

## Why this matters

Without this protocol binding, a GUI can degrade into a semantic smoothing layer that hides uncertainty, source direction, and dependency order.
That would violate the spirit of CIEL/0 even if the interface looks polished.

## Practical rule

A good desktop surface under CIEL/0 should always satisfy:

presentation <= truth

never:

presentation > truth

## Long-term implication

As the engine contract becomes more explicit, the desktop layer should consume cleaner and more formally typed truth surfaces.
That will make CIEL/0 compliance easier to validate downstream as well as upstream.
